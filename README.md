# ARC-Solver
### 1. Another Rubik's Cube (ARC) Solver

- Have you ever wanted to solve a Rubik's Cube but didn't want to bother memorizing all the steps? Well now you can with the help of this. 
### 2. **What is ARC?**
- It is what it says on the tin. Using computer vision and maybe some AI, the application will give you step-by-step details on how to solve the Rubik's cube you have in your hand. While the project isn't bleeding edge and is as exciting as toasted bread, the project aims to be a place where members can learn how to implement computer vision to solve a problem that is easy for anyone to understand.
### 3. **The Vision**
- With this project, success is easy to quantify. If you come in with an unsolved Rubik's cube and come out with a solved one, that's considered a success.
- The skills learned, specifically how to implement computer vision in applications, could be used in more daring projects in the future.
### 4. **What You'll Be Doing**
**Technical Work**: 
	- You'll be teaching a computer how to see and recognize color.
**Creative/Design Elements**: 
	- Some simple design skills to just make the website look passable. 
### 5. **Disclaimer**
- Again, it is important to reiterate that this project isn't the most exciting thing in the world. If you have bigger and bolder aspirations, you're better off looking for something more exhilarating than this. However, if you're content with keeping things grounded and want a project that can easily be summed up in a sentence, then you're welcome to join.
### 6. **What You Need**
**Technical Requirements**: 
	- Web development skills are required as the project is meant to be hosted on the web.
	- Maybe some Python in case the technology used to achieve Computer Vision requires it. But in all honesty, we'll try to look for a JS implementation so we won't have to bother with Python.
**Mindset Requirements**: 
	- Being comfortable with the idea that this project might go nowhere.
### 7. **Project Structure**
- Duration (3 sprints over 10 weeks)
**Deliverable options**: 
	- A simple website that can solve a Rubik's Cube for you. There's not much else here.
### 8. **Is This Project Right for You?**
Be brutally honest with two sections:
**You might love this project if:**
	- You want to keep things simple.
	- You want as little to do with the vibes of AI as possible.
	- You want to familiarize yourself with a technology that you can put on your resume: Computer Vision.
	- You want to finish this course and maybe actually have something worth showing on your GitHub.
**You might prefer a different project if:**
	- You want something more bleeding edge.
	- You want to have AI in everything, including the kitchen sink.
	- You want a project that is harder to explain and even harder to find conventional applications to.
### 9. **Getting Started**
- If you got this far, then you're probably interested. The project is easily broken into three parts: learn how to teach the computer to see the colors on the cube, learn how to solve the cube from the colors given, and then how to put everything on the web.
- Simple. Easy to understand. Realistic. Plausible.
**Let's get this bread and toast it.**
